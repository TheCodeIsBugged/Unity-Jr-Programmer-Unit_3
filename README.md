In this Unit, you will program a fast-paced endless side-scrolling runner game where the player needs to time jumps over oncoming obstacles to avoid crashing. In creating this prototype, you will learn how to add music and sound effects, completely transforming the experience of your projects. You will also learn how to create dynamic endless repeating backgrounds, which are critical for any side-scrolling games. Finally, you will learn to incorporate particle effects like splatters and explosions, which make your games so much more satisfying to play.

Challenge Overview: 
Apply your knowledge of physics, scrolling backgrounds, and special effects to a balloon floating through town, picking up tokens while avoiding explosives. You will have to do a lot of troubleshooting in this project because it is riddled with errors. 

Challenge Outcome:
1. The balloon floats upwards as the player holds spacebar
2. The background seamlessly repeats, simulating the balloon’s movement
3. Bombs and Money tokens are spawned randomly on a timer 
4. When you collide with the Money, there’s a particle and sound effect
5. When you collide with the Bomb, there’s an explosion and the background stops
